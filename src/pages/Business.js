          <h1>Cement</h1>
          Cement cargoes, can prove to be extremely problematic when carried in
          conventional bulk carriers as opposed to specialized cement carriers.
          If not dealt with in an appropriate manner, cement carriage can result
          in delay for a significant period of time. The main problems with
          cement cargo arise when holds are not initially dry, clean and
          watertight. The majority of claims arising from cement cargo are
          caused by the following factors:
          <br />
          <br />• Solidification when wet
          <br />• Contamination by residues of previous cargoes
          <br />• Retention of heat when loaded warm <br />
          <br />
          Juggernaut let the cement cargoes be transported through the suitable
          cement carriers to avoid any loss of goods and time.
