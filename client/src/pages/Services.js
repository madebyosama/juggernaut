          <h1>Load Tracking</h1>
          Our on – demand live - tracking provides real-time tracking and highly
          accurate delivery windows for your truckload shipments carrier
          integrations. This enables you to never miss out on critical updates
          including transit times, terminal updates, carrier appointment times
          and ETA. With live – tracking, managers have the ability to rapidly
          identify drivers who are not driving their vehicles in an effective
          manner. In addition, when drivers are aware that they are being
          closely monitored, they are more inclined to drive with better driving
          practices, obey guidelines, and take the routes that are the shortest
          distance between two points. Live tracking solutions improve customer
          support by reducing reaction times and boosting overall efficiency.{' '}
          For a firm with a fleet of vehicles, fuel is a major operating
          expense. Using real-time tracking, business owners may better control
          these costs by reducing idle time, optimising dispatching and routing,
          monitoring speed, and receiving an alert when maintenance is required
          on their fleet vehicles.

          Juggernaut’s fuel card is used as a payment card most commonly for
          gasoline, diesel, and other fuels at gas stations. You may end up
          overspending on fuel if you pay drivers' expenses based on the number
          of miles they drive. If our fuel card is used, you'll always know
          exactly how much your company is spending on fuel and can avoid
          overspending. Juggernaut’s fuel card eliminates the need to keep a
          receipt for each transaction. All transactions conducted at the pumps
          will be recorded on invoices, which will be available to customers.
          You can request a printed copy of the weekly fuel invoice from your
          provider, which will be sent to you via email each week.

          <h1>Dash Cam</h1>
          Our dash cam service can offer much more than just simple footage of a
          driver’s journey. With a plethora of features, dash cams give drivers
          an advantage in driver awareness and safety, and if combined with
          a radar detector, they create the ultimate driver alert system. Having
          a second set of eyes on the road through a dash cam recording can help
          prove fault in accidents and is a great way to make sure your
          insurance premiums don’t increase. Another great reason to have a dash
          cam is to be able to catch hit-and-run drivers. Insurance rates can
          change due to a number of factors, including age, commute distance,
          and driving record. Speeding tickets and accidents can cause your
          insurance rate to jump, sometimes to over triple what they were. In
          the event of an accident, having a dash cam that offers incident
          reports allows our clients to streamline the claims process for a
          faster experience and to prove that you weren’t at fault. Dash cams
          are not only a convenient device for providing you with peace of mind,
          they can help save you time and money in the event of an accident.
